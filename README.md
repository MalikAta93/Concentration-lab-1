Lab 3 – Set Improved Including Gestures This assignment gives you experience building your own custom view including handling custom multi-touch gestures. As in the real world, this lab builds on work you have already created. Requirements: A. Upgrade your lab 2 submission so that when the game starts with 12 cards, they are large, but as you continue to “Deal 3 More Cards”, they become smaller as more cards appear on the screen. When there are no more cards in the Set deck (still 81 cards total), then the cards displayed should revert to becoming larger. Ensure this works properly in Landscape and portrait mode on all iPhones and iPads using all space available in each instance. B. Cards must have a “standard” look and feel (i.e.  1, 2 or 3 squiggles, diamonds or ovals that are solid, striped or unfilled and are either green, red or purple) drawn using UIBezierPath and or CoreGraphics functions. Do not use attributed strings nor UIImages to draw cards in this lab. Don’t forget to ensure what you pick scales in size up
